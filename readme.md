## Geojson <=> ESRI JSON converter

Copy in JSON from an ArcGIS REST endpoint and get GeoJSON out. There are several
[node libraries](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-to-geojson-utils) to do this,
but sometimes it's quicker to just do it in the browser.

Works great with 100 records, not great with 1,000.
